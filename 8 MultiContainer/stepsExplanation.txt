Apologies for the inconvenience. The issue you are facing might be due to the network configuration between the Flask application and the Redis database. To establish communication between multiple containers running in different pods, we need to ensure they can reach each other.

Here's an updated example with modifications to the Flask application and Kubernetes configuration files to address this issue:

Step 1: Updated Python Flask Application
We'll modify the Python Flask application to use the hostname "redis" as the Redis server address. This hostname will resolve to the Redis container's IP address within the Kubernetes cluster.

Update the `app.py` file with the following content:

```python
from flask import Flask
import redis

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='redis', port=6379, decode_responses=True)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    redis_client.incr('hits')
    total_hits = redis_client.get('hits')
    return f'Hello, this page has been visited {total_hits} times!\n'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
```

Step 2: Updated Redis Configuration
The Redis container should be part of the same pod as the Flask container to allow communication between them. Instead of deploying Redis as a separate deployment, we'll run it as a sidecar container within the Flask pod.

Update the `flask-deployment.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: flask-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: flask-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: flask-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: flask-app
          image: <your-registry>/flask-app:v1
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: REDIS_HOST
              value: "localhost"  # Use "localhost" as the Redis host since both containers are in the same pod.
        - name: redis
          image: redis:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 6379
```

Step 3: Deploy the Updated Configuration
Apply the updated Flask application deployment to your Minikube cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f flask-deployment.yaml
```

Step 4: Expose the Flask Application
To access the Flask application from outside the cluster, we need to expose it using a Kubernetes Service. Create a file named `flask-service.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: flask-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: flask-app
  ports:
    - protocol: 'TCP'
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Apply the service to your Minikube cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f flask-service.yaml
```

Step 5: Access the Application
After a few moments, the service should be exposed with an external IP address. You can check it using:

```bash
minikube service flask-app-service --url
```

Access the Flask application using the external IP address:

```bash
curl <external-ip-address>
```

Now, the Flask application should be able to connect to the Redis database successfully, as both containers are running in the same pod, allowing them to communicate using "localhost" as the Redis host.
