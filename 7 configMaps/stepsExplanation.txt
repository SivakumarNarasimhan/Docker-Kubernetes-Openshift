Sure! Let's walk through a detailed example of using ConfigMaps in Kubernetes with a Python application.

Assume you have a simple Python application that requires some configuration settings, such as a database URL or an API key. Instead of hardcoding these values into your application code, you can use a ConfigMap to store and manage these configuration settings externally.

Step 1: Python Application
Let's create a simple Python application that reads a configuration value from an environment variable and prints it. Create a file named `app.py` with the following content:

```python
import os

config_value = os.environ.get("CONFIG_VALUE", "default_value")
print("Config Value:", config_value)
```

Step 2: Dockerize the Python Application
Next, we need to create a Docker image for our Python application. Create a `Dockerfile` with the following content in the same directory as `app.py`:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install the required dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Set the environment variable for the application
ENV CONFIG_VALUE=default_value

# Run the Python application
CMD [ "python", "app.py" ]
```

Step 3: Build and Push the Docker Image
Build the Docker image and push it to a container registry of your choice. Replace `<your-registry>` with your actual container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, or Amazon ECR):

```bash
docker build -t <your-registry>/my-python-app:v1 .
docker push <your-registry>/my-python-app:v1
```

Step 4: Create the ConfigMap in Kubernetes
Now, let's create a ConfigMap to store the configuration value for our Python application. Create a file named `config.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  CONFIG_VALUE: my_config_value_from_config_map
```

In this example, we are setting the `CONFIG_VALUE` key in the ConfigMap to the value `my_config_value_from_config_map`. You can replace this with your actual configuration value.

Apply the ConfigMap to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
```

Step 5: Deploy the Python Application
Finally, create a Kubernetes deployment to run your Python application using the ConfigMap. Create a file named `deployment.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-python-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-python-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-python-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-python-app
          image: <your-registry>/my-python-app:v1
          env:
            - name: CONFIG_VALUE
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: my-config
                  key: CONFIG_VALUE
```

Replace `<your-registry>` with your actual container registry as before. This deployment uses the ConfigMap `my-config` to set the `CONFIG_VALUE` environment variable in the container.

Apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Step 6: Verify the Output
After a few moments, the deployment should be running. To verify that the configuration value from the ConfigMap is being used by the application, check the logs of the pod:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

You should see the output:

```
Config Value: my_config_value_from_config_map
```

Congratulations! You have successfully used a ConfigMap to configure a Python application deployed in Kubernetes. This method allows you to manage the configuration separately from the application code and makes it easier to update configurations without rebuilding the application container.
